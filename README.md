# MetropAccess-Reititin

MetropAccess-Reititin is a tool for measuring accessibility by public transport. Transport schedules used in the MetropAccess-Reititin are based on open timetable data (Kalkati XML) from the Helsinki Regional Transport Agency (HRT). The tool allows the calculations of public transport routes, travel times and distances between different origin and destination locations in the Helsinki Region. The whole travel chain (“door-to-door approach”) is taken into account in the calculations. It is also possible to add new routes into the analysis.

The tool has been developed gradually together with different collaborators. The latest version (version 1.2), was developed together with Busfaster Oy, a private start-up company specialized in public transport analysis.
